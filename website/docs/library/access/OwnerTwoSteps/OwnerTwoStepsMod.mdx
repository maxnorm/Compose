## Overview

This module implements a secure two-step ownership transfer mechanism, preventing accidental ownership loss. It adheres to standard ownership patterns, providing functions to manage current and pending owners, and enforce ownership restrictions.

## Functions

### acceptOwnership

Finalizes ownership transfer; must be called by the pending owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function acceptOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "PendingOwnerStorage",
      description: "The PendingOwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Returns the current owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### pendingOwner

Returns the pending owner (if any).

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function pendingOwner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### renounceOwnership

Renounce ownership of the contract Sets the owner to address(0), disabling all functions restricted to the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### requireOwner

Reverts if the caller is not the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function requireOwner() view;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### transferOwnership

Initiates a two-step ownership transfer.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoSteps} from "./interfaces/IOwnerTwoSteps.sol";
import {OwnerTwoStepsMod} from "./OwnerTwoStepsMod.sol";

contract MyFacet {
    IOwnerTwoSteps immutable ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _diamondAddress) {
        // Assuming OwnerTwoStepsMod is deployed and its facet address is known
        // This is a placeholder address, actual implementation would fetch facet address
        address ownerFacetAddress = address(0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890);
        ownerFacet = IOwnerTwoSteps(ownerFacetAddress);
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptNewOwner() external {
        ownerFacet.acceptOwnership();
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function getPendingOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.pendingOwner();
    }

    function protectMyFunction() external {
        ownerFacet.requireOwner();
        // ... owner-only logic ...
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Always use `transferOwnership` followed by `acceptOwnership` to change ownership, ensuring security against accidental renunciations or transfers to incorrect addresses.
- Implement `requireOwner()` checks within your facets for any sensitive operations that should only be executable by the contract owner.
- Be aware of the owner address when deploying or upgrading facets; ensure ownership is correctly transferred to the intended party.
</Callout>

## Integration Notes

<Callout type="success" title="Shared Storage">
This module utilizes distinct storage slots for owner and pending owner addresses, defined by `OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION` and `PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`. Facets interacting with ownership should use the provided getter functions (`owner()`, `pendingOwner()`) or directly access these storage slots via inline assembly if necessary. Ensure these storage positions do not conflict with other facets. Changes to owner or pending owner are immediately visible through the respective getter functions.
