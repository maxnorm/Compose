Manages ownership transfer with a two-step confirmation process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Two-step ownership transfer process (`transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership`) for enhanced security.
- Explicit functions to view current and pending ownership (`owner`, `pendingOwner`).
- Ability to renounce ownership permanently (`renounceOwnership`).
</Callout>

## Overview

This facet provides a robust ownership management system for Compose diamonds, implementing a two-step transfer process to prevent accidental or malicious ownership changes. It allows for transferring ownership to a new address, which must then accept the transfer, ensuring a secure handover.

## Functions

### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable

/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "../interfaces/IOwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract Deployer {
    function deployOwnerFacet(address diamondProxy) public {
        // Assume OwnerTwoStepsFacet contract is deployed and its address is known
        address ownerFacetAddress = 0x...; // Replace with actual address

        // Get the selector for transferOwnership
        bytes4 transferOwnershipSelector = IOwnerTwoStepsFacet.transferOwnership.selector;

        // Add the facet to the diamond proxy (this is usually done by the diamond deployer)
        // ... diamond.diamondCut(...) ...

        // Interact with the facet through the diamond proxy
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet ownerFacet = IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(diamondProxy);

        // Initiate ownership transfer
        address newOwner = 0xNewOwnerAddress; // Replace with actual address
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(newOwner);

        // The new owner would then call acceptOwnership() on the diamond proxy
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership via an explicit deployment process rather than relying on default contract constructors.
- Always use the `transferOwnership` function to initiate a transfer, followed by the recipient calling `acceptOwnership`.
- Ensure that the `renounceOwnership` function is only called when the intention is to permanently remove ownership, making the contract effectively immutable regarding ownership changes.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access to `transferOwnership`, `acceptOwnership`, and `renounceOwnership` is restricted to the current owner. The `transferOwnership` function requires the `onlyOwner` modifier, preventing unauthorized initiation of transfers. Input validation is handled by the `onlyOwner` modifier and the internal logic for checking if the caller is the current owner or the pending owner.
