<DocSubtitle>
Manage diamond ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Implements a two-step ownership transfer process for enhanced security.
- Provides functions to query the current and pending owner addresses.
- Allows for ownership renouncement by the current owner.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerTwoSteps facet implements a secure, two-step ownership transfer mechanism for Compose diamonds. It prevents accidental ownership loss by requiring both the current owner to initiate a transfer and the new owner to accept it. This facet provides essential owner querying functions and manages the lifecycle of ownership changes.

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {DiamondCutFacet} from "@compose/diamond/DiamondCutFacet.sol";
import {OwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/access/OwnerTwoSteps/OwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract MyDiamond is DiamondCutFacet {
    address internal constant OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256(\"compose.owner\");
    address internal constant PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256(\"compose.pendingOwner\");

    struct OwnerStorage {
        address owner;

    }

    function renounceOwnership() external {
        address owner = this.owner();
        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");
        delete getOwnerStorage().owner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the diamond with the contract deployer as the initial owner.
- Use `transferOwnership` followed by `acceptOwnership` for secure owner transitions.
- Ensure the `OwnerTwoStepsFacet` is added to the diamond's facets during deployment or upgrades.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function is only callable by the current owner. The `acceptOwnership` function is only callable by the pending owner. The `renounceOwnership` function is only callable by the current owner. The `OwnerUnauthorizedAccount` error is emitted when an unauthorized account attempts an ownership-related action.
