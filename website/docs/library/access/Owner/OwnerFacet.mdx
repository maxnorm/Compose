Manages diamond ownership and transfer.

- Manages diamond ownership and administrative control.
- Supports ownership transfer and renouncement.
- Emits `OwnershipTransferred` event upon successful ownership changes.

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functions for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows for retrieving the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative access and upgradeability.

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}

      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/diamond/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerFacetConsumer {
    IOwnerFacet immutable ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _diamondProxyAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_diamondProxyAddress);
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Only the current owner should call `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`.
- Use `transferOwnership(_newOwner)` to delegate ownership before renouncing.
- Ensure the `_newOwner` address is valid and intended before execution.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access to `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership` is restricted to the current owner. Care must be taken when transferring ownership to ensure the new owner is trusted, as they will have administrative control over the diamond. Renouncing ownership makes the contract immutable and un-upgradable unless other mechanisms are in place.
