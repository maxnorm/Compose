Manages contract ownership and transfers.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Clearly defines and enforces contract ownership.
- Provides programmatic control over ownership transfers.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functionality for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows querying the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is fundamental for access control and administrative operations within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "bytes32",

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Events

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnershipTransferred" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnerUnauthorizedAccount" defaultOpen={false}>

      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {DiamondProxy} from "@compose/core/DiamondProxy.sol";
import {OwnerFacet, IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/access/Owner/OwnerFacet.sol";

contract MyDiamond is DiamondProxy {
    function owner() external view returns (address) {
        return IOwnerFacet(address(this)).owner();
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        IOwnerFacet(address(this)).transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceOwnership() external {
        IOwnerFacet(address(this)).renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership during diamond deployment. The initial owner is typically the deployer.
- Use `transferOwnership` for planned ownership changes, and `renounceOwnership` only when ownership is no longer required.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership changes must be carefully managed. Ensure that `transferOwnership` is called with the correct `_newOwner` address to prevent accidental loss of control or transfer to unauthorized accounts. The `OwnerUnauthorizedAccount` error is emitted if a non-owner attempts to call administrative functions. `transferOwnership` allows setting the new owner to `address(0)` to renounce ownership.
