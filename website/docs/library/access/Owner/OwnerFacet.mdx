Manages diamond ownership and transfer.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Provides standard ERC-173 ownership pattern.
- Allows for programmatic ownership transfer and renouncement.
- Exposes storage slot for direct access via `getStorage` (advanced usage).
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functions for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows for retrieving the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative functions and upgradeability within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: "Diamond storage slot position for this module"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### getStorage

Returns a pointer to the owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Events

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnershipTransferred" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnerUnauthorizedAccount" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
error OwnerUnauthorizedAccount();
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/diamond/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerCaller {
    IOwnerFacet immutable ownerFacet;

    constructor(address diamondAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(diamondAddress);
    }

    function getOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Ensure the OwnerFacet is initialized with the correct owner during diamond deployment.
- Access administrative functions guarded by ownership checks judiciously, preferably through dedicated facets that call these owner-related functions.
- Consider the implications of renouncing ownership, as it makes administrative control irreversible.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership is a critical administrative privilege. Ensure that `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership` are only callable by the current owner. The `owner` function is view-only and safe. Input validation for `_newOwner` in `transferOwnership` should prevent zero addresses unless explicitly for renouncement. No reentrancy concerns as functions do not make external calls or modify state in a way that allows reentrancy.
