## Overview

The OwnerTwoStepsFacet facilitates robust ownership management within a diamond proxy contract. It enables a two-step ownership transfer mechanism, ensuring deliberate transitions and minimizing the risk of accidental or unauthorized changes. This facet is essential for secure and transparent administrative control in decentralized applications.

- Two-step ownership transfer to enhance security.\n- Functions to retrieve both current and pending ownership details.

## Structs

### OwnerStorage

```solidity
struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}
```

### PendingOwnerStorage

```solidity
struct PendingOwnerStorage {
    address pendingOwner;
}
```

## Storage

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: ""
    },
    {
      name: "PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: ""
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

```solidity
function getOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);
```

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

```solidity
function getPendingOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);
```

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "PendingOwnerStorage",
      description: "The PendingOwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### owner

Get the address of the owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address);
```

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### pendingOwner

Get the address of the pending owner

```solidity
function pendingOwner() external view returns (address);
```

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the pending owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;
```

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### acceptOwnership

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() external;
```

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external;
```

## Events

### OwnershipTransferStarted

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferStarted(address indexed _previousOwner, address indexed _newOwner);
```

### OwnershipTransferred

```solidity
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed _previousOwner, address indexed _newOwner);
```

## Errors

### OwnerUnauthorizedAccount

```solidity
error OwnerUnauthorizedAccount();
```

## Usage Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport { IDiamondCut } from &quot;./IDiamondCut.sol&quot;;\n\ncontract ExampleDiamond {\n    address private constant OWNER_FACET_ADDRESS &#x3D; 0x123...;\n\n    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external {\n        (bool success, ) &#x3D; OWNER_FACET_ADDRESS.delegatecall(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(&quot;transferOwnership(address)&quot;, _newOwner)\n        );\n        require(success, &quot;Transfer ownership failed&quot;);\n    }\n\n    function acceptOwnership() external {\n        (bool success, ) &#x3D; OWNER_FACET_ADDRESS.delegatecall(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(&quot;acceptOwnership()&quot;)\n        );\n        require(success, &quot;Accept ownership failed&quot;);\n    }\n\n    function owner() external returns (address) {\n        (bool success, bytes memory result) &#x3D; OWNER_FACET_ADDRESS.delegatecall(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(&quot;owner()&quot;)\n        );\n        require(success, &quot;Query owner failed&quot;);\n        return abi.decode(result, (address));\n    }\n}
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Ensure the correct implementation of diamond storage positions to avoid conflicts with other facets.\n- Implement ownership-related functions with strict access control to preserve administrative integrity.\n- Regularly test the ownership transfer and acceptance process in isolated environments to confirm accuracy and reliability.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Always validate the new owner address in &#x60;transferOwnership&#x60; to avoid setting invalid or unintended addresses. Require explicit calls by the pending owner for &#x60;acceptOwnership&#x60; to finalize transfers securely. Ensure no state collisions in storage when integrating with other facets.
