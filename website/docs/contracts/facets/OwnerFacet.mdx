<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Manages the single owner of the diamond contract.
- Supports transferring ownership to a new address, including the ability to renounce ownership by setting the new owner to the zero address.
- Provides a &#x60;getStorage&#x60; function for direct access to ownership-related storage, useful for advanced diagnostics or initial deployment setup.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides core ownership management capabilities for a Compose diamond. It allows for retrieving the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely, ensuring clear administrative control over the diamond&#x27;s upgradeability and critical functions.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: ""
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### getStorage

Returns a pointer to the owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}

## Errors

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/diamond/contracts/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerConsumer {
    IOwnerFacet private ownerFacet;

    function setOwnerFacet(address _facetAddress) external {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_facetAddress);
    }

    function getOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize OwnerFacet&#x27;s storage correctly during diamond deployment. The owner address should be set to the initial deployer or a designated admin address.
- Access ownership-related functions through the diamond proxy address, not directly to the facet&#x27;s address, to ensure proper routing and access control.
- Be cautious when transferring ownership; ensure the new owner is a trusted address capable of managing the diamond.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership is a critical administrative privilege. Ensure that &#x60;transferOwnership&#x60; and &#x60;renounceOwnership&#x60; are only callable by the current owner. Setting the owner to &#x60;address(0)&#x60; effectively relinquishes all administrative control, which should be done with extreme caution. The &#x60;getStorage&#x60; function bypasses standard function call interfaces and should be used with a deep understanding of the diamond&#x27;s storage layout and slot positions.
